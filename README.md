# qt_camera_calibration
A Qt5 GUI to simplify the camera calibration process using OpenCV

The software allows to create a camera model from scratch or to refine the parameters of a model previously calculated.

The calibration process is "Real Time", you can see how the "undistorted" image changes during the calibration/refine process for each Chessboard detected, so you can evaluate the correctness of the whole process while advancing.

The software support the "standard" Pinhole Camera Model (using 8 distorsion parameters) and the FishEye model for camera with optics with a FOV bigger then 140Â°

1. Launch the application.
2. If necessary, select a camera.
3. If necessary, select Resolution and FPS.
4. Click the "Start Camera" button to start.
5. Check / uncheck "Fisheye" checkbox according to the mode required.
6. If necessary, modify Chessboard parameters (Number of inner corners per a chessboard row and column etc.).
7. Click "Calibrate" to start calibration.
8. Click "Calibrate" again when you have finished collecting projection images.
9. Click "Save" to save the camera settings.
